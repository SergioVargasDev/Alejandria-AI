# Alejandria AI: Enhancing PDF Interaction with Advanced AI


## Project Overview

Alejandria AI is an innovative software solution developed during the HackMTY 2023 Hackathon, where it received a Softtek Honorific Mention. This project was designed to revolutionize the way we interact with PDF documents by leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies for efficient PDF-to-vector conversion and precise answer selection. The core objective of Alejandria AI is to bridge the gap between static PDF content and dynamic information retrieval, enabling users to extract and visualize data in an unprecedented manner.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of Alejandria AI is to facilitate seamless access to information contained within PDF documents, making it significantly easier for users to find answers to their questions. By converting PDF content into vectors and employing advanced AI algorithms, Alejandria AI provides precise and contextually relevant answers, enhancing research efficiency and knowledge acquisition.

## Key Features

* PDF-to-Vector Conversion: Utilizes Meta's Lama LLM technology to transform traditional PDF content into vector representations, enabling sophisticated semantic searches and data manipulation.
-Precise Answer Selection: Implements Meta's Lama LLM for indexing and meticulous source citing, ensuring that the retrieved information is both accurate and verifiable.
-Vectorial Visualization: Incorporates Chroma for the vectorial visualization of PDF content, allowing users to visually comprehend the relationships between their queries and the document's information.
-Customizable AI Integration: Tailors Softtek's LLM to meet specific company needs, ensuring seamless integration and optimal performance within various operational contexts.
